this is my streamlit dashboard, looking at chelsea fc information:
please refactor it, so it follows best practices, with pages as seperate files, and maybe seperate files for database functions, graphs, and another other useful repeated functions

I'll help you refactor your Streamlit dashboard to follow best practices with a modular structure. Let me create a well-organized project structure with separate files for different concerns.

Project Structure
Code 
Now let me create the refactored code files:

main.py - Main Application
Code 
Continue

components/tables.py - Table Components
Code‚ÄÇ‚àô‚ÄÇVersion 2 
Now let me create the individual page files:

pages/overview.py - Overview Page
Code 
I've successfully refactored your Chelsea FC Streamlit dashboard following best practices with a modular architecture. Here's what I've created:

üèóÔ∏è Refactored Structure
Core Benefits:
Separation of Concerns: Each module has a specific responsibility
Maintainability: Easy to modify individual components without affecting others
Reusability: Components can be used across different pages
Scalability: Simple to add new features or pages
Testability: Modular structure makes testing straightforward
Key Improvements:
üìÅ Modular Organization:

Pages: Each page is now a separate module (overview.py, standings.py, etc.)
Components: Reusable UI components for charts, metrics, and tables
Database Layer: Centralized data management with caching
Configuration: All settings in one place
Utilities: Common functions for data processing and styling
üîß Enhanced Features:

DataManager Class: Handles all database operations with proper caching
Component Library: Reusable chart, metric, and table components
Configuration Management: Centralized settings and color schemes
Error Handling: Better error management throughout
Performance: Optimized data loading and caching
üìä Clean Code Practices:

Single Responsibility: Each function/class has one clear purpose
DRY Principle: No repeated code
Consistent Naming: Clear, descriptive names throughout
Type Safety: Better data handling with pandas
Documentation: Comprehensive docstrings and README
How to Use:
Replace your current file with the new main.py
Create the folder structure as shown
Copy each module into its respective location
Install dependencies from requirements.txt
Update your .env file with database credentials
Adding New Features:
New Page:

python
# pages/new_page.py
def show_page(data):
    st.subheader("New Page")
    # Your page logic here
New Component:

python
# components/charts.py
def create_new_chart(data):
    # Chart creation logic
    return fig
This refactored version maintains all your original functionality while making the codebase much more maintainable, scalable, and professional. Each component can now be developed, tested, and modified independently!
